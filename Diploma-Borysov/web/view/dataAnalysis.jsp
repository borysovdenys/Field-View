            <h3><p align="justify">Crop health mapping, infrastructure mapping, soil mapping and water flow mapping
                Queensland Drones works with farmers, agronomists, seed suppliers, rural stores, crop consultants,
                grower groups and agriculture departments to help improve farm outcomes through application of precision
                agriculture techniques. We have been at the forefront of development of innovative and economically
                viable agricultural drone services.

                The uptake of drone data for use by farmers has been slower than anticipated, largely because drone
                suppliers and some drone services providers have over-promised and under-delivered. This has led to a
                loss in confidence as to what drones can really do to enhance farm management and reduce costs. This has
                been particularly true in NDVI crop health mapping where poor data collection has discredited what is an
                otherwise extremely valuable source of crop information.

                Despite these setbacks, more than 33% of farmers are now using drones or drone service providers to get
                better, faster and more accurate data about their fields and crops, and a further 31% have indicated
                they intend to start using drones within the next 12 months. So if you re not using drones by the end of
                this year, you will be in a minority and potentially less competitive than your neighbours.

                The most cost-effective and valuable applications we have developed so far for drones in agriculture
                include:

                using NDVI combined with EM soil mapping data to detect crop health issues
                accurate infrastructure maps for allocating fields, planning crops and access tracks
                precision field contour data for levelling and irrigation/fertigation planning
                precision water flow and water accumulation mapping for drainage and dam planning
                comparative strip health mapping for seed trials, mulch trials and micro-nutrient trials
                plant counting for validation of day labour and contractor planting costs
                rapid mapping of the extents of pest and disease invasions into crops
                checking and testing the effectiveness of large area irrigators (e.g. detecting blocked nozzles)
                species identification and mapping for vegetation clearance permits and environmental assessments
                Queensland Drones is not just limited to data collected by drones. We also operate ground-based soil
                analysis tools to provide electromagnetic (EM) soil characteristics mapping which, when combined with
                zonal soil sampling and testing, provides one the most accurate and versatile field and crop planning
                tools currently available.</p></h3>
